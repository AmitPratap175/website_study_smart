The daily demand for widgets in each location is uncertain and independent of each other. Demands and corresponding probability values (in parenthesis) are given against each location (A, B, C, and D) in the figure below. For example, there is a 40% chance that the demand in Ahmednagar will be 50 units and a 60% chance that the demand will be 70 units. The lines in the figure connecting the locations and warehouse represent two-way roads connecting those places with the distances (in km) shown beside the line. The distances in both the directions along a road are equal. For example, the road from Ahmednagar to Bikrampore and the road from Bikrampore to Ahmednagar are both 6 km long. Every day the supplier gets the information about the demand values of the four locations and creates the travel route that starts from the warehouse and ends at a location after visiting all the locations exactly once. While making the route plan, the supplier goes to the locations in decreasing order of demand. If there is a tie for the choice of the next location, the supplier will go to the location closest to the current location. Also, while creating the route, the supplier can either follow the direct path (if available) from one location to another or can take the path via the warehouse. If both paths are available (direct and via warehouse), the supplier will choose the path with minimum distance. ",

The houses are located in six columns - Column-A through Column-F, and two rows - Row-1 and Row-2. The houses are divided into two blocks - Block XX and Block YY. The diagram also shows two roads, one passing in front of the houses in Row-2 and another between the two blocks. Some of the houses are occupied. The remaining ones are vacant and are the only ones available for sale. The road adjacency value of a house is the number of its sides adjacent to a road. For example, the road adjacency values of C2, F2, and B1 are 2, 1, and 0, respectively. The neighbour count of a house is the number of sides of that house adjacent to occupied houses in the same block. For example, E1 and C1 can have the maximum possible neighbour counts of 3 and 2, respectively. The base price of a vacant house is Rs. 10 lakhs if the house does not have a parking space, and Rs. 12 lakhs if it does. The quoted price (in lakhs of Rs.) of a vacant house is calculated as (base price) + 5 × (road adjacency value) + 3 × (neighbour count). The following information is also known.\n\n1. The maximum quoted price of a house in Block XX is Rs. 24 lakhs. The minimum quoted price of a house in block YY is Rs. 15 lakhs, and one such house is in Column-E.\n\n 2. Row-1 has two occupied houses, one in each block.\n\n 3. Both houses in Column-E are vacant. Each of Column-D and Column-F has at least one occupied house.\n\n 4.

For example, Suresh had ₹10 at the end of Rounds 1, 3 and 8 and not after any of the other rounds. The maximum amount that he had at the end of any round was ₹13 (at the end of Round 5), and the minimum amount he had at the end of any round was ₹8 (at the end of Round 2). At the end of all other rounds, he must have had either ₹9, ₹11, or ₹12. It was also known that Pulak and Qasim had the same amount of money with them at the end of Round 4. ",

In each round every player shot an arrow at a target. Hitting the centre of the target (called bull’s eye) fetched the highest score of 5. The only other possible scores that a player could achieve were 4, 3, 2 and 1. Every bull’s eye score in the first three rounds gave a player one additional chance to shoot in the bonus rounds, Rounds 4 to 6. The possible scores in Rounds 4 to 6 were identical to the first three. A player’s total score in the tournament was the sum of his/her scores in all rounds played by him/her. The table below presents partial information on points scored by the players after completion of the tournament. In the table, NP means that the player did not participate in that round, while a hyphen means that the player participated in that round and the score information is missing. The following facts are also known.\n\n1.Tanzi, Umeza and Yonita had the same total score.\n\n 2.Total scores for all players, except one, were in multiples of three.\n\n 3.The highest total score was one more than double of the lowest total score.\n\n 4.The number of players hitting bull’s eye in Round 2 was double of that in Round 3.\n\n 5.Tanzi and Zeneca had the same score in Round 1 but different scores in Round 3.

The table below shows the ranks of the ten states/UTs mentioned above among ALL states/UTs of India in terms of the number of cases registered in each of the three category of crimes. A state/UT is given rank r for a category of crimes if there are (r‐1) states/UTs having a larger number of cases registered in that category of crimes. For example, if two states have the same number of cases in a category, and exactly three other states/UTs have larger numbers of cases registered in the same category, then both the states are given rank 4 in that category. Missing ranks in the table are denoted by *. ",

There were two phases in the event with the first phase consisting of rounds 1, 2, and 3, and the second phase consisting of rounds 4, 5, and 6. A throw is measured in terms of the distance it covers (in meters, up to one decimal point accuracy), only if the throw is a ‘valid’ one. For an invalid throw, the distance is taken as zero. A player’s score at the end of a round is the maximum distance of all his throws up to that round. Players are re-ranked after every round based on their current scores. In case of a tie in scores, the player with a prevailing higher rank retains the higher rank. This ranking determines the order in which the players go for their throws in the next round.

Table-1 gives information about the raw materials required to produce the five finished products. One unit of a finished product requires one unit of each of the raw materials mentioned in the second column of the table. One unit of milk, mango, apple, and banana cost ₹5, ₹3, ₹2, and ₹1 respectively. Each unit of a finished product is sold for a profit equal to two times the number of raw materials used to make that product. For example, apple smoothie is made with two raw materials (apple and milk) and will be sold for a profit of ₹4 per unit. Leftover raw materials are sold during the last business hour of the day for a loss of ₹1 per unit. The amount, in rupees, received from sales (revenue) for each woman in each of the four business hours of the day is given in Table-2. The following additional facts are known.\n\n1. No one except possibly Ganga sold any Mango smoothie.\n\n 2. Each woman sold either zero or one unit of any single finished product in any hour.\n\n 3. Each woman had exactly one unit each of two different raw materials as leftovers.\n\n 4. No one had any banana leftover. ",

Here's a clean walk-through and the unique solution.\n Setup:\n Let $f_1,...,f_7$ be the number of students who failed in classes 1–7 in 2017 (each is a distinct single-digit natural number).\n Let $N$ be the number of new entrants into 1st class for 2018.\n Rules $\rightarrow$ relations:\n Students who pass class $i$ in 2017 (that's $40-f_1$ for class 1, $48-f_2$ for class 2, etc.) move to class $i+1$ in 2018.\n Students who fail stay in the same class next year.\n New students only enter 1st class.\n So the equations for 2018 counts (using the table values) are:\n $N + f_1 = 50$\n $(40 - f_1) + f_2 = 41$\n $(48 - f_2) + f_3 = 46$\n $(53 - f_3) + f_4 = 58$\n $(70 - f_4) + f_5 = 64$\n $(32 - f_5) + f_6 = 36$\n $(44 - f_6) + f_7 = 48$\n Each $f_i$ is in ${1,2,...,9}$ and all are distinct.\n Solution (by solving the system / checking integer possibilities):\n The unique solution that satisfies all equations and the distinct single-digit condition is:\n $f_1 = 3$\n $f_2 = 4$\n $f_3 = 2$\n $f_4 = 7$\n $f_5 = 1$\n $f_6 = 5$\n $f_7 = 9$\n From equation (1), $N = 50 - f_1 = 50 - 3 = 47$. So 47 new students entered 1st class in 2018.\n Extra checks (passes in 2017):\n Number who passed each class in 2017 (i.e., moved forward):\n class 1: $40 - 3 = 37$\n class 2: $48 - 4 = 44$\n class 3: $53 - 2 = 51$\n class 4: $70 - 7 = 63$\n class 5: $32 - 1 = 31$\n class 6: $44 - 5 = 39$\n class 7: $72 - 9 = 63$ (these 63 passed 7th and left the school)\n These produce the given 2018 numbers when combined with the failures and new entries — so the solution is consistent and unique.\n If you want, I can show the algebra step-by-step or produce a small script that brute-forces the possibilities and prints the same result. Which would you prefer?\n",
