One evening, Rohit and his friends went to the restaurant. They planned to choose two different vegetarian items and three different non-vegetarian items from the entire menu. Later, Bela and her friends also went to the same restaurant: they planned to choose two different vegetarian items and one non-vegetarian item only from the gluten-free options. The number of item combinations that Rohit and his friends could choose from, given their plan, was 12 times the number of item combinations that Bela and her friends could choose from, given their plan. How many menu items contain gluten?\n\n**Options:**\n- **A**. 1\n- **B**. 2 ✅\n- **C**. 3\n- **D**. 4\n- **E**. 5\n\n**Correct Answer:** 2"

X: LTU had the same enrolment in consecutive years at least twice between 2014 and 2021. Y: The increase in JSU's enrolment from 2015 to 2019 is about 50% of TRU's total enrolment in 2020.

The maximum speed limits along any stretch of road are as shown in the diagram. The straight road that connects Meereen to Gulltown passes through Oldtown. Another straight road, running west to east, connecting Meereen to Winterfell, passes through Lannisport. Further, two straight roads, one from Lannisport to Oldtown and another from Winterfell to Gulltown, are perpendicular to the road joining Meereen to Winterfell, and run from south to north. Consider a car always travelling at the maximum permissible speed, and always taking the shortest route. It takes 1 hour to reach Oldtown from Meereen, 2 hours to reach Gulltown from Oldtown, and 45 minutes to reach Winterfell from Gulltown. (For this problem, always consider the shortest route in terms of distance.) ",

He has the option of running the unit at normal speed or at 110% of normal - “fast speed”. He estimates that he will be able to run at the higher speed for 60% of the time. The packet is twice as likely to be damaged at the higher speed which would mean temporarily stopping the process. If a packet on a randomly selected packaging runs has probability of 0.112 of damage, what is the probability that the packet will not be damaged at normal speed?\n\n**Options:**\n- **A**. 0.81\n- **B**. 0.93 ✅\n- **C**. 0.75\n- **D**. 0.60\n- **E**.

In the production process, he incurs raw material cost, selling cost (for packaging and transportation) and labour cost. These costs per kurta vary across factories. In all these factories, a worker takes 2 hours to produce a kurta. Profit per kurta is calculated by deducting raw material cost, selling cost and labour cost from the selling price (Profit = selling price - raw materials cost - selling cost - labour cost). Any other cost can be ignored.  ",
