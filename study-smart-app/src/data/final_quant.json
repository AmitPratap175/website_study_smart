After buying, he realizes that x number of earphones are not working and cannot be sold. He marks up the price of the remaining earphones to Rs. M where M is a natural number. y number of earphones are not properly packed, and hence, the shopkeeper offered a 50% discount on them. If he sells the remaining earphones at the marked price and earns a total profit of 20%, which of the following cannot be the value of x and y?\n\nOptions:\n- A. x = 9, y = 2\n- B. x = 7, y = 8 ✅\n- C. x = 13, y = 24\n- D. x = 8 , y = 24\n\n**Solution:** Let the amount at which he sells earphones in good condition be Rs n.    Therefore, he sells (50−x−y)(50 - x - y )(50−x−y) earphones at Rs n each i.e. he earns Rs (50−x−y)n(50 - x - y)n(50−x−y)n after selling earphones in good condition also it is given that y number of earphones are not properly packed and could only be sold after giving a 50% discount. Therefore, he sells these y earphones at Rs n/2 each earning Rs yn/2. His total profit is 20%, i.e. he sells all the items at 50*100*1.2 = Rs 6000.

Therefore, the sum of roots should be greater than 0. ⇒\\Rightarrow⇒ −BA-\\dfrac{B}{A}−AB​ > 0   ⇒\\Rightarrow⇒ −(a−4)a-\\dfrac{(a-4)}{a}−a(a−4)​ > 0   ⇒\\Rightarrow⇒ a−4a\\dfrac{a-4}{a}aa−4​ < 0   ⇒\\Rightarrow⇒ 0<a<40 < a < 40<a<4 ... (1)    It is given that the quadratic equation has both the roots greater than 0. Therefore D ≥\\geq≥ 0    ⇒\\Rightarrow⇒ (a−4)2−4∗(a)∗(a+1)≥0(a-4)^2-4*(a)*(a+1) \\geq 0(a−4)2−4∗(a)∗(a+1)≥0 ⇒\\Rightarrow⇒ a2−8a+16−4a2−4a≥0a^2-8a+16-4a^2-4a \\geq 0a2−8a+16−4a2−4a≥0    ⇒\\Rightarrow⇒ −3a2−12a+16≥0-3a^2-12a+16 \\geq 0−3a2−12a+16≥0    ⇒\\Rightarrow⇒ 3a2+12a−16≤03a^2+12a-16 \\leq 03a2+12a−16≤0    ⇒\\Rightarrow⇒ −6−2213≤a≤−6+2213\\dfrac{-6-2\\sqrt{21}}{3} \\leq a \\leq \\dfrac{-6+2\\sqrt{21}}{3}3−6−221​​≤a≤3−6+221​​    ⇒\\Rightarrow⇒ −5.05≤a≤1.05-5.05 \\leq a \\leq 1.05−5.05≤a≤1.05 ... (2) From equation (1) and (2), we can see that 'a' can be equal to 1. Let's figure out the value of both the roots explicitly at a = 1.    At a = 1, we can see that the equation reduces to x2−3x+2=0x^2-3x+2=0x2−3x+2=0. Therefore, x = 1 or 2. We can say that at a = 1, both the roots of the given equation are greater than 0.       Hence, we can say that there is only one integer value (a=1) integer value of 'a' for which both the root of the quadratic equation ax2+(a−4)x+a+1=0ax^2+(a-4)x+a+1=0ax2+(a−4)x+a+1=0 are greater than 0.\n\nCorrect Answer: 1"

The ratio of water and alcohol in vessel P and vessel Q are 2:3 and 1:4. After combining Q and R in the ratio 1:2, the resulting mixture contains the water and alcohol in the ratio 4:11. Find the percentage of water in a mixture which has P, Q and R combined in a ratio 3:5:2.\n\n\n**Solution:** Assume the amount of water per litre mixture of R = x   After Q and R in the ratio 1:2, the ratio of water and alcohol = 4:11   Assuming the volume of Q = 5 litres, then volume of R will be 10 litres,   Hence, water in 5 litres of Q = 51+4×1\\frac{5}{1+4}\\times\\ 11+45​×1 = 1 litre   Water in 10 litres of R = 10x   Hence total water in the mixture = (10+5)×44+11\\left(10+5\\right)\\times\\ \\frac{4}{4+11}(10+5)×4+114​ = 10x+1   => x = 0.3   Now, if P, Q and R are combined in 3:5:2, then the volume can be assumed as 30, 50 and 20.   So amount of water in P = 30×25=1230\\times\\ \\frac{2}{5}=\\ 1230×52​=12   Similarly, amount of water in Q = 50×1550\\times\\ \\frac{1}{5}50×51​ = 10   The amount of water in R = 20×0.3=620\\times\\ 0.3\\ \\ =620×0.3=6   Hence, the total amount of water in (30+50+20) = 100 litres mixture = 12+10+6 = 28 litres   Hence, the percentage = 28\n\nCorrect Answer: 28"

Case 2: 24<=x<32 ∣x+5∣x−32∣+∣24−x∣∣<5\\left|x+5\\left|x-32\\right|+\\left|24-x\\right|\\right|<5∣x+5∣x−32∣+∣24−x∣∣<5 ∣x−5(x−32)−(24−x)∣<5\\left|x-5\\left(x-32\\right)-\\left(24-x\\right)\\right|<5∣x−5(x−32)−(24−x)∣<5 ∣x−5x+160−24+x∣<5\\left|x-5x+160-24+x\\right|<5∣x−5x+160−24+x∣<5 ∣−3x+136∣<5\\left|-3x+136\\right|<5∣−3x+136∣<5 Since 24<=x<32, −3x+136<5-3x+136<5−3x+136<5 −3x<−131-3x<-131−3x<−131 3x>1313x>1313x>131 x>42.xxx>42.xxx>42.xx Hence, again, we get no overlapping in the number line, hence, this region does not satisfy the equation.
